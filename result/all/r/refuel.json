(汽车在加油站加油) / The plane has refuelled and is ready to take off. (飞机已经加满油，准备起飞) / We are refuelling the car before the long trip. (我们在长途旅行前给汽车加油) / The truck was refuelled after the delivery. (卡车在送货后加满了油) / The plane is currently refuelling. (飞机正在加油) / They are refuelling the engines of the ship. (他们正在给船的发动机加油) / The tanker truck is being refuelled by the service station staff. (油罐车正在由服务站工作人员加油) / The jet needs to be refuelled before it can continue its flight. (喷气式飞机需要加油才能继续飞行) / The pilot ordered the crew to start refuelling the aircraft immediately after landing. (飞行员命令机组人员在着陆后立即开始给飞机加油) / The driver stopped at a gas station to get some more fuel for his car during his journey across town; he didn't want his vehicle running out of power halfway through his trip! He knew that if he didn't keep an eye on how much fuel was left in his tank, he might end up stranded somewhere along the way with no way to get back home again! So, he made sure to check his gas gauge regularly while driving around town so that he could plan ahead accordingly whenever necessary! And when he finally reached his destination later that evening after having driven all day long without any problems whatsoever—thanks largely due in part because of how well-prepared he had been beforehand by making sure everything was taken care of properly beforehand—he felt relieved knowing that everything had gone according to plan after all! Because even though there were times during his travels when things didn't always go exactly as expected, at least now everything was finally over with once and for all! And so, as soon as possible after arriving safely back home again later that night, he decided right away then and there without hesitation whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever",
