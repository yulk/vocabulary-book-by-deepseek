  "analysis": "### 分析词义\n\n\"Living\" 是一个多义词，可以作为形容词和名词使用。作为形容词时，它主要表示“活着的”、“现存的”、“在使用的”等意思；作为名词时，它表示“生活”、“生计”。\n\n### 列举例句\n\n1. **场景一：描述生物**\n   - **例句**: The living room is where we relax after a long day.\n   - **中文翻译**: 客厅是我们一天劳累后放松的地方。\n   \n2. **场景二：描述生活方式**\n   - **例句**: She leads a simple living in the countryside.\n   - **中文翻译**: 她在乡下过着简单的生活。\n   \n3. **场景三：描述状态**\n   - **例句**: The painting is a living testament to his talent.\n   - **中文翻译**: 这幅画是他才华的生动证明。\n\n### 词根分析\n\n- **词根**: \"liv-\" 来自拉丁语 \"livere\"，意思是“活着的”或“居住的”。\n- **衍生单词**: \n  - alive (活着的)\n  - live (活的，现场的)\n  - livelihood (生计)\n  - lively (活泼的)\n  - liver (肝脏) [与生命相关的器官]\n  \n### 词缀分析\n- **形容词后缀**: \"-ing\"，表示进行时或状态。例如：living, loving, running。  \n- **相同后缀单词**:  \n  - running (跑步的)  \n  - swimming (游泳的)  \n  - dancing (跳舞的)  \n  这些单词都带有\"-ing\"后缀，表示正在进行或状态。  \n    例如: He is running in the park. (他正在公园里跑步。)     She loves dancing in her free time. (她空闲时间喜欢跳舞。)     They are swimming in the pool. (他们正在泳池里游泳。)    These examples show how \"-ing\" is used to describe ongoing actions or states.    In \"living,\" it describes the state of being alive or currently in use.    For example: This is a living room, where people live and relax. (这是一个客厅，人们在这里生活和放松。)     Similarly, \"living\" can also describe something that is currently active or existing, such as a living language or a living legend.    For example: English is a living language spoken by millions worldwide. (英语是一种全球数百万人使用的活语言。)     Or: She is considered a living legend in the music industry. (她在音乐界被视为活着的传奇人物。)    These examples illustrate how \"-ing\" can be used to describe both physical and abstract states of being alive or active.     Additionally, \"living\" can also refer to one's means of earning money, such as a living wage or making a living from writing.    For example: He earns a modest living as a freelance writer. (他作为一名自由撰稿人过着简朴的生活。)     Or: They struggle to make ends meet on their small living wage. (他们努力靠微薄的工资维持生计。)    In summary, \"-ing\" in \"living\" can describe various aspects of being alive, active, or currently in use, depending on the context it is used in.     It is important to note that while \"-ing\" often indicates ongoing actions or states, it can also be used to form nouns that describe activities or professions, such as \"swimming,\" \"dancing,\" and \"writing.\"    However, in the case of \"living,\" it primarily describes the state of being alive or currently existing, rather than an activity itself.    For example: The living room is where people live and relax; it is not an activity but rather a space for living activities to take place.     Similarly, when referring to someone's livelihood or means of earning money, \"living\" describes their state of earning money rather than the activity of earning money itself.    For example: She earns her living by teaching English; here, \"living\" refers to her state of earning money through teaching rather than the act of teaching itself.    In conclusion, \"-ing\" in \"living\" primarily describes states of being alive or currently existing rather than activities themselves; however, it can also be used to form nouns that describe activities when combined with other words like \"swimming,\" \"dancing,\" and \"writing.\"",
