  "analysis": "### 分析词义\n\n\"Lengthen\" 是一个动词，意思是“延长”或“变长”。它可以用来描述时间、距离或物体的长度增加。\n\n### 列举例句\n\n1. **场景一：描述时间延长**\n   - The meeting was lengthened by an extra hour due to unexpected discussions.\n   - 由于意外的讨论，会议延长了一个小时。\n\n2. **场景二：描述物体变长**\n   - She decided to lengthen her skirt by adding a fabric panel.\n   - 她决定通过添加一块布料来加长她的裙子。\n\n3. **场景三：描述影子变长**\n   - As the sun set, the shadows on the ground began to lengthen.\n   - 随着太阳落山，地上的影子开始变长。\n\n### 词根分析\n\n- **词根**: \"leng-\" 来自古英语 \"lengþu\"，意思是“长度”。\n- **衍生词**: \"length\"（名词，长度）、\"lengthy\"（形容词，冗长的）。\n\n### 词缀分析\n\n- **后缀**: \"-en\" 是一个常见的后缀，用于将形容词或名词转换为动词，表示“使……成为”或“使……变得”。例如：\"widen\"（加宽）、\"strengthen\"（加强）。\n- **相同后缀的单词**: \"soften\"（使变软）、\"harden\"（使变硬）。\n\n### 发展历史和文化背景\n\n\"Lengthen\" 这个词源自中古英语的 \"lengthenen\"，进一步追溯到古英语的 \"lengþu\"。在日常生活中，这个词常用于描述时间、空间或物体的延长。在西方文化中，时间的延长通常与效率低下或计划外的事件相关联，而空间的延长则可能与美学或功能性需求有关。\n\n### 单词变形\n\n- **动词**: lengthen (延长)\n- **名词**: length (长度) [注意：lengthen 的名词形式是 length]\n- **形容词**: lengthy (冗长的) [注意：lengthen 的形容词形式是 lengthy]\n- **副词**: lengthily (冗长地) [注意：lengthen 的副词形式是 lengthily]\n- **固定搭配**: \"lengthen out\" (拉长，拖延)、\"lengthen the process\" (延长过程)。例如：The project was lengthened out due to unforeseen delays.
