  "analysis": "### 分析词义\n**Mount** 是一个多义词，可以用作动词和名词。\n\n- **动词**：\n  - 攀登、爬上（如山、梯子等）。\n  - 安装、装配（如设备、装置等）。\n  - 发动（攻击）。\n  \n- **名词**：\n  - 山峰、山丘。\n  - 底座、支架。\n\n### 列举例句\n1. **动词用法**：\n   - He **mounted** the ladder carefully.  \n     *他小心翼翼地爬上了梯子。*  \n   - The technician **mounted** the new hard drive.  \n     *技术人员安装了新的硬盘。*  \n   - The army **mounted** an attack on the enemy base.  \n     *军队对敌军基地发动了攻击。*  \n   \n2. **名词用法**：  \n   - Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world.  \n     *珠穆朗玛峰是世界上最高的山峰。*  \n   - The statue was placed on a marble **mount**.  \n     *雕像被放置在大理石底座上。*  \n   \n### 词根分析\n- **词根**: \"mount\" 源自拉丁语 \"mont-\"，意为“山”或“上升”。这个词根与“mountain”（山）同源。其他衍生词包括：  \n  - **mountain**: 山，大山。  \n  - **amount**: 数量，源自“上升到一定数量”的概念。  \n  - **dismount**: 下马，拆卸（反义词）。  \n   \n### 词缀分析\n- **mount**本身没有明显的词缀，但它的衍生形式中包含一些常见的后缀和前缀：  \n  - **re-mount**: re-表示“再次”，remount意为“重新安装”或“重新爬上”。   \n   例如：He remounted his bike after fixing the tire. *他修好轮胎后重新骑上了自行车。*   \n   其他带有re-前缀的单词：rebuild, restart, retell等。   \n   此外，mount也可以与其他后缀结合形成新词，如mounting（形容词，表示“逐渐增加的”）或mounted（形容词，表示“安装好的”）。例如：The mounting pressure forced him to make a decision. *逐渐增加的压力迫使他做出决定。*      The mounted camera captured the entire event. *安装好的摄像机记录了整个事件。*      Other words with similar suffixes: departed (形容词), departed (动词过去式), mounted (形容词), etc.      However, it's important to note that while some of these forms may share similar roots or meanings with mount, they are not direct derivatives and have developed their own distinct uses over time. For example, while both depart and dismount share a root meaning related to movement away from something (depart being more general while dismount specifically refers to getting off something like a horse), they have evolved separate connotations and applications in modern English usage. Similarly, although both mount and amount share a root meaning related to rising or increasing in some way (mount referring more directly to physical climbing or installation while amount refers more abstractly to quantities increasing), they too have developed separate connotations and applications over time within English vocabulary usage patterns today.",
