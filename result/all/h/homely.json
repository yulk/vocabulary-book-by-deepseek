  "analysis": "### 分析词义\n\n\"Homely\" 是一个形容词，主要有两个常见的含义：\n\n1. **温馨的、朴素的**：形容一个地方或环境给人一种舒适、温暖的感觉，通常与家庭相关。例如，一个布置简单但充满爱的家可以被描述为 \"homely\"。\n   \n2. **相貌平平的、不漂亮的**：在某些情况下，\"homely\" 也可以用来形容一个人外表普通，甚至有些不好看。这个含义在现代英语中使用较少，但在一些文学作品中仍然可见。\n\n### 列举例句\n\n1. **温馨的、朴素的**：\n   - The cottage had a homely atmosphere, with its cozy fireplace and soft lighting.  \n     （这个小屋有一种温馨的氛围，有舒适的壁炉和柔和的灯光。）\n   \n   - She prepared a homely meal with simple ingredients that reminded us of our childhood.  \n     （她用简单的食材准备了一顿温馨的饭菜，让我们想起了童年。）\n   \n2. **相貌平平的、不漂亮的**：\n   - Although she was not conventionally beautiful, her homely appearance was warm and approachable.  \n     （虽然她不是传统意义上的美女，但她那朴实的外表让人感到温暖和亲切。）\n   \n### 词根分析\n\n- **词根**：\"home\"（家）是这个词的核心部分，表示与家相关的概念。\"ly\" 是常见的形容词后缀，表示“具有……性质的”。因此 \"homely\" 的字面意思就是“像家一样的”或“家的性质”。\n  \n- **衍生词**：基于 \"home\" 这个词根，还有许多其他单词，如：  \n  - **homeward**（回家的）  \n  - **homemade**（自制的）  \n  - **homesick**（想家的）  \n  - **homeless**（无家可归的）  \n  - **homeowner**（房主）  \n  - **hometown**（家乡）  \n  - **homework**（家庭作业）等。  \n  这些词都与“家”这个概念有关。  \n   比如：She felt homesick after moving to a new city. (她搬到新城市后感到想家了。)    或者 He prefers homemade cookies to store-bought ones. (他更喜欢自制的饼干而不是商店买的。)     再如 They are homeowners now, having just bought their first house.
